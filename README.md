# BabyMonitor
Baby Monitor Application Leveraging Kinect SDK v2

This project exists as an exploration of adulthood and the Kinect SDK.

The goal is to see how much information can be gleaned from a single static Kinect.

At a bare minimum this should include Color and Infrared Video feeds as well as audio.

But it could potentially attempt heart rate and respirartory rate monitoring, and an estimation of temperature.

Likely less reliably, but possibly entertaining would be leveraging the face source to detect whether the subject
is awake or asleep, as well as their mood.
